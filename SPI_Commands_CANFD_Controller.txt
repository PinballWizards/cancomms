//Project:    CANFD Testbed
//Purpose:    This is the SPI script to be sent to the CANFD testbed
//Assumption: CRC reads and Writes are not needed


//Configure the CANFD Controller
0x2E 04 00  //Write the GPIO Pins as Outputs

//Flash the CANFD I/O pins - SFR Read Instruction - Single Byte
0x2E 05 03  // Latch both GPIO Pins as high
0x2E 05 02  // Latch GPIO1 high; GPIO0 low
0x2E 05 01  // Latch GPIO1 low; GPIO0 high
0x2E 05 00  // Latch GPIO1 low; GPIO0 low

//Send a message to the other CANFD Controller


//Read a message from the other CANFD Controller
